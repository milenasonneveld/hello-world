# Hello world

We are Yannick, Milena and Florent who started the project of Vélo M² in Brussels, which base is a renewable energy platform on a cargo bike. The electricity comes from ordinary bicycles on bike stands that generate the energy, we call it people pedal powered. We like to power our open-air cinéma, our mobile 3D fablab or anything else. With 4 people on the pedals you can already show a movie -in contrast you need to invite 20 friends to heat the water for your coffee.

* discover how to plan a PPP event * and even more on our website www.velom2.be.

Don't hesitate and come to get to know us on one of our discovery days or on www.facebook/velom2.

I'm Milena and I'exploring energy flows to discover renewable energy in an abundant world.
